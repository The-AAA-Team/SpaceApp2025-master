# Dataship: The Space Biology Knowledge Engine ðŸš€

## Introduction: Dataship â€“ A New Era for Space Biology Research

**Dataship** is a revolutionary informatics platform developed to address a critical challenge in space exploration: making decades of accrued NASA space biology knowledge accessible and actionable. Built as a direct response to the **2025 NASA Space Apps Challenge**, "Build a Space Biology Knowledge Engine," Datashipâ€™s mission is to unlock the full potential of scientific literature that details how living systems, including humans and plants, respond to the space environment.

The sheer volume and diversity of NASAâ€™s in-space experiment publications present a comprehension barrier for scientists, managers, and mission architects. Dataship solves this by functioning as a dynamic dashboard that curates, summarizes, and connects this vast corpus of information. Its innovative architecture is centered on leveraging **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** for massive-scale summarization and a **Knowledge Graph (KG)** for visually mapping the complex relationships within the data, effectively transforming a trove of results into a unified, explorable database ready for the next phase of lunar and Martian missions.

## AI-Powered Article Summarization and Data Curation

The foundation of Dataship is its powerful AI summarization pipeline, which systematically processes **over 600 scientific articles**. The user-specified dataset consists of **608 NASA bioscience publications**â€”each a crucial record of experimental results and findings. Manually reviewing this data set is resource-intensive and prone to missing subtle connections; Dataship automates this intellectual heavy lifting.

The AI system is engineered to perform targeted text analysis, moving beyond simple abstracts to extract core data points. This process likely involves techniques like **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** to identify key entities (e.g., specific species, genes, missions, and biological effects) and **Abstractive or Extractive Summarization** to condense dense sections (like Results and Conclusions) into concise, objective statements. By focusing on the core findings of each paper, Dataship transforms unstructured scientific text into structured data. This AI curation is vital for mission planners seeking immediate, actionable insights, or scientists looking to quickly identify areas of consensus, disagreement, or scientific gaps that require further research to ensure safe and efficient exploration.

## The Knowledge Graph: Revealing Interconnected Insights

While AI summarization provides the necessary building blocks, Datashipâ€™s implementation of a **Knowledge Graph (KG)** is where the true strategic value is generated. The KG acts as the system's brain, transforming discrete summaries into an interconnected web of knowledge.

In the Dataship model, each extracted entityâ€”a publication, an experiment, an observed effect, a species, or a keywordâ€”is a **node** in the graph. The relationships between these entities (e.g., "Publication X *describes* Experiment Y," or "Experiment Y *observed* Effect Z *in* Species A") are represented as **edges**. This relational structure is crucial for visualizing and querying information that spans multiple disciplines and decades.

The knowledge graph allows users to perform highly sophisticated interrogations that would be impossible with standard keyword searches. For example, a user could ask: "Which publications that studied *Arabidopsis thaliana* on the International Space Station also observed changes in gene expression related to radiation resistance?" The KG instantly maps the connections, enabling the identification of **knowledge gaps** where data is sparse or the discovery of **emerging patterns** across seemingly unrelated studies. By emphasizing the connections between data points, Dataship provides a powerful, interactive tool that moves space biology research from data consumption to knowledge generation, directly serving the needs of future deep-space human exploration efforts.
