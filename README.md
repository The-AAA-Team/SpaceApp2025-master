# DataShip
DataShip is a database designed for biologists wanting to get a quick summary of 600+ publications. With the potential for even more publications to be added to the website, biologists are able to sort through all the articles by keywords, authors, and year range. A knowledge graph allows for a quick understanding of the connections between articles and how each article relates.

# Usage of Artificial Intelligence
* We used the Google Generative AI Gemini to output summaries of each publication by giving it the article.
* Google Generative AI was used in the backend to create keywords as JSON data.
* We used multiple chatbots, such as Gemini, Claud, ChatGPT, and DeepSeek, to create and rewrite code in the backend and the frontend.
* Artificial Intelligence WAS NOT used in: Generating images, generating audio, generating video.
