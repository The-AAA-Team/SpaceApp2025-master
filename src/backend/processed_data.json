They then analyzed the mice's pelvic bones using micro-CT and nano-CT for structural changes and RT-qPCR to measure gene expression.\n\n*   **Key Finding 1 (Bone Structure):** Space-flown mice exhibited significant bone loss, with a 6.3% decrease in bone volume fraction and an 11.9% decrease in bone thickness, alongside a 170% increase in surfaces covered by bone-resorbing osteoclasts.\n\n*   **Key Finding 2 (Osteocytic Osteolysis):** High-resolution nano-imaging revealed that the lacunae (cavities housing bone cells) were 17% larger in space-flown mice.
